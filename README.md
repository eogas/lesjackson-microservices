Dumping ground for code as I work through [Les Jackson's .NET Microservices youtube course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgVjEo3OGBI).

## Notes
I'm developing this on my M1 mac. So far everything has worked fine save for the SQL Server image. After some googling
I see that folks recommend the Azure SQL Edge image as an alternative for amd64 hosts. I'll try to do this for now, but
once I have time to do some independent hacking on this, I'll set it up to use a different DB.
